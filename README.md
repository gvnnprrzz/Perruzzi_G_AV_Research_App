# A/V Accessibility Research Project - Media for Everyone

This project aims to create and deploy a fully accessible Node/Express media application using two pieces of multimedia (1 audio file and 1 video file) while following best practices for audio, video, and special needs. The goal is to develop and implement standard accessibility features based on the resources provided and individual research.

## Features

- Create a fully accessible Node/Express media application using two pieces of multimedia (1 audio file and 1 video file)
- Design a user-friendly interface that is fully accessible and inclusive to enable all users, regardless of their abilities, to navigate the app.
- Create a couple of pages that display the audio and video assets with multimedia controls
- Use routing with Node and Express to separate the audio and video presentations/pages
- Deliver each media selection with the goal of any user, regardless of accessibility challenges, being able to enjoy any media in any application
- Include a design/development document with the submission as the roadmap

## Installation and Setup

1. Install Git and Node.js on your computer.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to download the app.
3. Use the git clone command to download the app (run git clone <repository-url>).
4. Navigate to the app directory (run cd <app-directory>).
5. Use the npm package manager to install the app's dependencies (run npm install in the terminal).
6. Run the app using the node command in the terminal (run node app.js or node index.js, depending on the name of the main file).
7. Access the app in your web browser by navigating to the URL http://localhost:<port>, where <port> is the port number the app is listening on.
